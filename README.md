At work, I ask Google a lot of questions. Some of the answers, so as not to search again, I collect here.



1.   How to read .arff file
2.   How to quickly change to number-categorical values from b'asdf'
3.   How to transform log-normal distribution to normal with np.log
4.   Groupby and cut, qcut for analysis
5.   Give quickly the categorical columns from names
6.   To see the NaNs visually
